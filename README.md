**THIS REPO IS DEPRECATED**

As an IUC member, I decided to move development to the [official IUC tool repository](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/tree/video-viz/visualizations/video)
until further notice. The below is retained for historical reasons.

# Galaxy Video Viz Plugin

This plugin allows for viewing of videos (mp4 files) directly in the galaxy interface.

Galaxy, now with cute cat videos

# Requirements

This library depends on the `mp4` [datatype](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/eric-rasche/video_datatypes)

# Design

It is powered by [video.js](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/), with two plugins: speed controls (play video faster/more slowly), and frame-by-frame controls to allow stepping through a video in increments.

# Installation

Installation is slightly more complicated than normal, because I use git and submodules so as to track upstream repositories

```bash
cd $VIZ_PLUGIN_DIR
git clone https://github.com/erasche/galaxy-video-viz-plugin.git video
cd video
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

The submodules are stored in the `ext/` folder. At this point, you should be ready to upload a video file and watch it through galaxy.

# Known Bugs

Currently does not support playback of anything but mp4 files. This is hardcoded, and will change eventually.
